WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net btn[1]_btn[3]_OR_11_o is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    28 out of   6,822    1%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        48 out of  13,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           97
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            45 out of      97   46%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               9 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
