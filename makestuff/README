MAKESTUFF BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE

Most of the software on makestuff.eu uses this cross-platform build
infrastructure to abstract the details of compilation away from individual
projects to a central location.

There are four subdirectories here:

  libs - Libraries (.dll, .lib, .so, .dylib, .a etc).
  apps - Executables (.exe etc).
  3rd - Third-party libraries, etc.
  scripts - A few useful scripts.

Once you've installed the infrastructure in a convenient location of your choice
(e.g $HOME/makestuff), you can then fetch and build some application code from
GitHub:

  cd $HOME/makestuff/apps
  ../scripts/msget.sh makestuff/lsep
  cd lsep
  make deps

This will fetch the master branch of the lsep source code and build it,
transitively fetching dependencies as necessary. You can build libraries in a
similar way:

  cd $HOME/makestuff/libs
  ../scripts/msget.sh makestuff/libbuffer
  cd libbuffer
  make deps

If instead of the master branch you wish to fetch the source code for the
development branch, you can do that like this:

  ../scripts/msget.sh makestuff/libbuffer/dev

Or if you want the source code for a specific release:

  ../scripts/msget.sh makestuff/libbuffer/20130701

If you fetch a different branch or a specific release, the dependencies will be
correctly matched when you do make deps.

If you have git installed and wish to fetch the code for editing, you can do so
using the msgit.sh script:

  ../scripts/msgit.sh makestuff/libbuffer

This time it defaults to fetching the dev branch. If you want a different
branch, you can specify it as before:

  ../scripts/msgit.sh makestuff/libbuffer/master

Cloning from GitHub in this way will only give you one local branch; to get
another of the remote branches you can do it with:

  git checkout -b dev origin/dev

Have fun!
